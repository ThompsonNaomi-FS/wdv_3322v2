### Naomi Thompson / Student ID: 0005007393 
 Hello, my name is Naomi. I am a student at Full Sail University living in Nebraska. The purpose of this repository is to practice development using version control.
 
I live in a small village with my husband, 2 dogs, and 4 cats. I enjoy video games, anime, reading, writing, playing piano, singing, drawing, painting my nails, and creative activities in general. I would love to learn some form of martial arts and sword fighting. The Lord of the Rings trilogy are my favorite movies and I am enthralled with Tolkien's works and other people's creations inspired by him. In addition to pursuing my Bachelor's degree, I work at a Walmart as a Personal Shopper. I am also a published author and manage my own website with WordPress.
